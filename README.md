# AWS-Scenario-Based-Questions
In , This Repo I will share the some AWS Related Scenario Based interview Questions which will be taken from the Help of My Mentor Abhishek veeramalla .

Her is the URl .

	1. You have been assigned to design a VPC architecture for a 2-tier application  . The application needs to be highly available and scalable .
	How would you design the VPC architecture ?
	Answer:
	In this scenario , I would design a VPC architecture in the following way .
	I would create 2 subnets :public and private . The public subnet would contain the load balancers and be accessible from the internet . The private subnet 	would host the application servers .
	I would distribute the  subnets across multiple Availability zones for High availability Zones for high availability . Additionally , I would configure 	auto scaling groups for the application servers .
	  2.Your organization has a VPC with multiple subnets . You want to restrict a outbound internet access for resources in one subnet , but allow outbound 		internet access for resources in another subnet . How would you achieve this ?
	Answer:
	To restrict outbound internet access for resources in one subnet , we can modify the route table associated with that the subnet . In the route table , we 	can remove the default route (0.0.0.0/0) that points to an internet gate way .
	This would prevent resources in that subnet from accessing the internet . For the subnet where outbound internet access is required , we can keep the 		default route pointing to the internet gateway.
 
	3. You Have a VPC with a public subnet and a private subnet . Instances in the private subnet need to access the internet for software updates . How would you allow internet access for instances in the private subnets ?
	Answer:
	 To allow internet access for instances in the private subnet , we can use the Internet Gateway or a NAT instance  .
	We would place the NAT Gateway/instance in the public subnet and configure the private subnet route table to send outbound traffic to the Nat Gateway\instance .
This way , instances in the private subnet can access the internet through the NAR Gateway\instance .

	4. You Have launched EC2 instances in your VPC , and you want them to communicate with each other using private IP addresses . What steps would take to Enable this communication ?

Answer:

By default , instances within the same VPC can communicate with each other using private IP addresses .
To ensure this communication , we need to make sure that the instances are launched in the same VPC and are placed in the same subnet or subnets that are connected through a peering connection or a VPC peering link .
Additionally , we should check the security groups associated with the instances to ensure that the necessary inbound and outbound  rules are configures to allow communication between them .

	5. You want to implement strict network access control for your  VPC resources . How would you achieve this ?
	
	Answer:
	To implement granular network access control for VPC resources , we can use Network Access control lists (ACLS) .
	NACLS are stateless and operate at the subnet level . We can define inbound and outbound rules in the NACLs to allow or deny traffic based on source and destination IP addresses , ports , and protocols .
	By carefully configuring NACLs rules , we can enforce fine-grained access control for traffic entering and leaving the subnets . 

	6. Your organization requires an isolated environment within the VPC for running sensitive workloads . How would you set up this isolated environment ?
	
	Answer:
	To set up an isolated environment within the VPC , we can create a subnet with no internet gateway attached .
	This subnet known as isolated subnet will not have direct internet connectivity . We can place the sensitive workloads in this subnet , ensuring that they are protected from inbound and outbound internet traffic .
	However , if these workloads require outbound internet access , we can set up a Nat Gateway or Nat instance in a different subnet and configure the isolated subnets 's route table  to send outbound traffic through the NAT Gateway/instance .
